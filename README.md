## Lab1

The goal of this exercise was to familiarize ourselves with path finding algorithms. The task was to create a maze with at least one path between a starting and an ending point. Then we implemented path finding algorithms based on A* and we evaluated their performance. 

## Lab2

The goal of this exercise was to create a movie recommender working with data found in [movies_metadata.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset?select=movies_metadata.csv). The recommendations derive from criterions written in prolog and from user ratings.

## Lab3

The goal of this task was to evaluate different supervised machine learning algorithms on [MNIST Dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). We also constructed our own versions of these algorithms (kNN, Naive Bayes, MLP) and compared them with the default ones from sklearn.
